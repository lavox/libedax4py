Also, see examples in example folder.

Usage
------
To execute your python script, you must set;

* path to libedax.dylib as environment variable `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`. (OSX)
* path to libedax-x86.dll as environment variable `PATH`. (Windows 32-bit)

You can specify book file and eval file with `libedax_initialize()` function.
